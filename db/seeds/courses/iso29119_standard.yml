        This document specifies test processes that can be used to govern, manage and implement software testing for any organization, project or testing activity. It comprises generic test process descriptions that define the software testing processes. Supporting informative diagrams describing the processes are also provided.
        This document is applicable to testing in all software development lifecycle models.
        This document is intended for, but not limited to, testers, test managers, developers and project managers, particularly those responsible for governing, managing and implementing software testing.

        This document defines test design techniques that can be used during the test design and implementation process that is defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119‑2.
        Each technique follows the test design and implementation process that is defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119‑2 and shown in Figure 1. This document is intended for, but not limited to, testers, test managers, and developers, particularly those responsible for managing and implementing software testing.

        This document defines an efficient and consistent solution for keyword-driven testing by:
        —     giving an introduction to keyword-driven testing;
        —     providing a reference approach to implement keyword-driven testing;
        —     defining requirements on frameworks for keyword-driven testing to enable testers to share their work items, such as test cases, test data, keywords, or complete test specifications;
        —     defining requirements for tools that support keyword-driven testing; these requirements are applicable to any tool that supports the keyword-driven approach (e.g. test automation, test design and test management tools);
        —     defining interfaces and a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from different vendors can exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test results);
        —     defining levels of hierarchical keywords, and advising use of hierarchical keywords; this includes describing specific types of keywords (e.g. keywords for navigation or for checking a value) and when to use "flat" structured keywords;
        —     providing an initial list of example generic technical (low-level) keywords, such as "inputData" or "checkValue"; these keywords can be used to specify test cases on a technical level and can be combined to create business-level keywords as required.
        This document is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven test specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords.
